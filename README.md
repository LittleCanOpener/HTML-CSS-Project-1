<h1>User Experience</h1><ul>

First time users should experience an immediate explanation of what the website is about and what it stands for judging by the Logo as well as the home page’s text box and the image below. With a working navigation bar at the top reacting to their mouse hovering over and moving between pages will leave the current page text bigger than the rest indicating where you are.
First time users should also find the website easy to use and navigate around and being 

<li><h2>Regular users</h2></li>

<h1>Design</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
The Purpose of this website Is to increase the efficiency of the club and to give back to a sport whom I fell in love with. Judo, I sustained an injury during one of the training sessions and have not been able to get back into it but this way I can give back to the community and the sport and the wonderful  people who organizing the trainings and effort brought to them can be made easier and simpler for everyone.<hr>
<h2>Translation</h2> 
The information gathered on the website was gathered from Icelandic news sites as well as speaking to members of the club and then translated from native Icelandic to English.<hr>

<h3>Lighthouse:</h3>
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk/related?hl=en" target="_blank">Lighthouse Extension</a>
<p>Was used to analyze the following aspects of a URL: Performance, Progressive Web App, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO.</p>
<p>A high Lighthouse score also means that you have a well performing website. The speed that a page loads at is extremely important as users do not want to sit around waiting for your webpage to load.</p>
<h4>How to access Lighthouse without Extension:</h4>
<ol><li>On any website if you are on windows you can press F12 on your keyboard and it will open the developer tool. From there you can access Lighthouse</li>
<li>You can also right click on pages and click "Inspect" and you'll have the same pathway to Lighthouse through developer tools.</li></ol><hr>

<h3>HTML:</h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a>
<p>Was used to construct the core of the website.</p>
<p><h4>Why HTML :</h4>HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images for Internet browsers. Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as elements or load images or other elements.</p><hr>

<img src="./assets/images/icons/CSS.svg" width="50px" height="50px">
<h3>CSS:</h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank">CSS</a>
<p>Was used to style the website after the core was made.</p>
<p><h4>Why CSS :</h4>CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and more.</p>
