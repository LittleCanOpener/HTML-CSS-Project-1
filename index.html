      <h3>The Beginning of Judo</h3><p>
        Made a comprehensive study of the ancient self-defence forms and integrated the best of these forms into a sport which is known as Kodokan Judo.
        The term Kodokan breaks down into ko (lecture, study, method), do (way or path), and kan (hall or place). Thus it means “a place to study the way”. Similarly judo breaks down into ju (gentle) and do (way or path) or “the gentle way”. 
        Prof. Kano adopted the superlative parts of all the Jujitsu schools, got rid of precarious parts and the Kodokan Judo was recognized in a few years to be excellent since its students overwhelmed the Jujitsu athletes at the Police Bujitsu Contest.
        The categorization of Kodokan Judo was completed about 1887. The Kodokan had three broad aims: physical education, contest proficiency and mental training.
        In his lifetime, Jigoro Kano attained a doctorate degree in Judo, a degree equivalent to the twelfth dan, awarded to the originator of Judo only. 
        He constantly worked to ensure the development of athletics and Japanese sport in general, and as a result is often called the ”Father of Japanese Sports”. 
        In 1935 he was awarded the Asahi prize for his outstanding contribution to the organizing of sport

    <legend class="about"><h3>About Kano Jigoro</h3></legend>
        <p>
        The early history of judo is inseparable from its founder, Japanese polymath and educator Kanō Jigorō 1860-1938 born Shinnosuke Jigorō.
          Kano was born into a relatively affluent family. His father, Jirosaku, was the second son of the head priest of the Shinto Hiyoshi shrine in Shiga Prefecture.
           He married Sadako Kano, daughter of the owner of Kiku-Masamune sake brewing company and was adopted by the family, changing his name to Kano. He ultimately became an official in the Shogunate government.
        Jigoro Kano had an academic upbringing and, from the age of seven, he studied English, shodō Japanese calligraphy and the Four Confucian Texts under a number of tutors.
         When he was fourteen, Kano began boarding at an English-medium school, Ikuei-Gijuku in Shiba, Tokyo.
          The culture of bullying endemic at this school was the catalyst that caused Kano to seek out a Jūjutsu dōjō at which to train.
        Early attempts to find a jujutsu teacher who was willing to take him on met with little success.
         Jujutsu had become unfashionable in an increasingly westernized Japan.
          Many of those who had once taught the art had been forced out of teaching or become so disillusioned with it that they had simply given up.
           Nakai Umenari, an acquaintance of Kanō's father and a former soldier,
           agreed to show him kata, but not to teach him. The caretaker of Jirosaku's second house, Katagiri Ryuji, also knew jujutsu, 
           but would not teach it as he believed it was no longer of practical use. Another frequent visitor, Imai Genshiro of Kyūshin-ryū school of jujutsu, also refused. 
           Several years passed before he finally found a willing teacher. In 1877, as a student at the Tokyo-Kaisei school, 
           Kano learned that many jujutsu teachers had been forced to pursue alternative careers, frequently opening Seikotsu-in. 
           After inquiring at a number of these, Kano was referred to Fukuda Hachinosuke 1828-1880, a teacher of the Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū of jujutsu, who had a small nine mat dōjō where he taught five students.
          Fukuda is said to have emphasized technique over formal exercise, sowing the seeds of Kano's emphasis on randori, randori, free practice) in judo.
        On Fukuda's death in 1880, Kano, who had become his keenest and most able student in both randori and kata, was given the densho of the Fukuda dōjō.
        Kano chose to continue his studies at another Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū school, that of Iso Masatomo 1820-1881. 
        Iso placed more emphasis on the practice of "kata", and entrusted randori instruction to assistants, increasingly to Kano.
        Iso died in June 1881 and Kano went on to study at the dōjō of Iikubo Tsunetoshi 1835-1889 of Kitō-ryū. 
        Like Fukuda, Iikubo placed much emphasis on randori, with Kitō-ryū having a greater focus on nage-waza.
